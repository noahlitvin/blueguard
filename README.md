As of 2016, ninety-one Americans die every day from an opioid overdose. Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in America, exceeding that of car accidents and firearm-related deaths.

**BlueGuard** is a product-service system to protect drug users from overdose death and connect them to counseling services. The centerpiece of this offering is the BlueGuard Connector, a pocket-sized, internet and GPS-enabled device. It functions as an overdose monitor with the ability to request a call from a harm reduction-trained counselor (called a “BlueGuard”) at the push of a button.

The use of an overdose monitor would lead to more overdoses being reversed, reducing the rate of accidental death among drug users. By pairing a counseling service offering with an overdose monitor and delivering this service remotely, participation in counseling would increase and health outcomes would improve among users.
